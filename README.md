Some Tips for CKA and CKAD.

## 2 - during the certification 
Build an alias script to be able to save time in command typing, here what I used for labs + certification. 
https://github.com/NicolasO/cka-preparation/blob/master/alias.sh

Note, the file is mendatory - first you can update any time and also if you loose the connection you will be able to reload quickly your bash environement. 

## 3 - issue during my certification 

I was full of luck during the exam ... or almost. I was not able to share my screen with my corporate laptop, I was able to start only my embeded laptop webcam not my external webcam. (I'm not speaking about the power outage in my bulding 5 minutes before start ...)
Starting from this I had to switch to another laptop to be able to share my screen and start my external webcam. So be aware, you may have to use another laptop :)

And of course during the exam I lost the connectivity with the certification (lucky me). In thie case, you will loose all "flags questions" you marked during your exam. So be aware the flags are not persistent :). I sugest to use the notepad or the chat with the examinator to mark your questions.
